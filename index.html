              Emily Prentiss is the a longtime member of the BAU who first
              joined the team two episodes after <a href="https://criminalminds.fandom.com/wiki/Elle_Greenaway">Elle Greenaway</a> resigned from
              the FBI for good. At the end of Season Seven, she resigned from
              the BAU and accepted a position with Interpol in London. She was
              replaced by <a href="https://criminalminds.fandom.com/wiki/Alex_Blake">Alex Blake</a>, who held the position until her own
              departure at the end of Season Nine.
            </p>
            <p>
              The position was then taken over by <a href="https://criminalminds.fandom.com/wiki/Kate_Callahan">Kate Callahan</a> for the duration
              of Season Ten before her own departure. She rejoined the team in
              Season Twelve and was then promoted to Unit Chief following the
              resignation of Aaron Hotchner.
            </p>
            <p>
              By 2022, Emily has been promoted to Section Chief, a position
              previously held by the late <a href="https://criminalminds.fandom.com/wiki/Erin_Strauss">Erin Strauss</a> and later <a href="https://criminalminds.fandom.com/wiki/Mateo_Cruz">Mateo Cruz</a>.

            <p>
              Emily Prentiss was born on October 12, 1970, at 7:12 a.m. Due to
              her mother's diplomatic background, Prentiss traveled a lot when
              she was a child, living in several Middle Eastern countries and at
              one point in Rome.
            </p>
            <p>
              She is a graduate of Chesapeake Bay University, where she earned
              her B.A. in Criminal Justice ("<a href="https://criminalminds.fandom.com/wiki/Annihilator">Annihilator</a>") and the University of
              Yale and has been working for the FBI for a little under ten
              years, primarily in the Midwest. Due to spending her early life
              with her parents on diplomatic missions to the Middle East, she
              speaks fluent Arabic and is familiar with that area's local
              culture. She also speaks fluent Spanish, French, Italian, and some
              Russian.

                damages people."

            <p>
              Prentiss is very level-headed and calm, sometimes it could be said
              that she seems to be dealing with the cases in an even more
              professional manner than some other members of the BAU. However,
              like <a href="https://criminalminds.fandom.com/wiki/Elle_Greenaway">Elle</a> before her, Prentiss lets her own emotions get the
              better of her on a few occasions. She has been shown to react
              emotionally at the crime scenes and feels a strong surge of
              empathy for the victims. She also appears highly intelligent and
              driven. Prentiss is willing to put herself at risk to protect
              others and has a very sarcastic sense of humor.

              As of "<a href="https://criminalminds.fandom.com/wiki/Just_Getting_Started">Just Getting Started</a>", Prentiss has been promoted to
              Section Chief, where she wrangles with the ambitious Deputy
              Director of the FBI for funding and resources while helping her
              team (now lead by Rossi) investigate a network of serial killers
              that they believe was formed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

                Prentiss was named after a great friend and fellow coworker of
                Criminal Minds' advisor, Jim Clemente, who wrote her first
                episode working full-time with the BAU, "<a href="https://criminalminds.fandom.com/wiki/Just_Getting_Started">Lessons Learned</a>"
              </li>
              <li>Her sidearm was a Glock 19.</li>
              <li>
                She speaks Spanish ("Catching Out," "A Rite of Passage," "A Thin
                Line"), Arabic ("Lessons Learned"), French (Lauren), and Italian
                ("Demonology") fluently; she is presumed to understand Russian
                well enough to watch the original 1972 film Solaris with Reid
                ("Sense Memory"), although her Russian, to her admittance, is
                "not very good" ("Honor Among Thieves").
              </li>
              <li>
                Her transfer to the BAU was not known to Hotch, and he was
                caught off guard when she reported for duty.
              </li>
              <li>
                Her first case was in the episode "Lessons Learned", where she
                helped to interrogate Jamal Abaza behind the scenes.
